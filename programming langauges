A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.
<br>
</br>
Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Early ones preceded the invention of the digital computer, the first probably being the automatic flute player described in 9th century by the brother musa in Baghdad, during the Islamic golden age.

programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands. Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer. The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a "binary". 
 
<br>
</br>
Translating programming language into binary is known as "compiling". Each language to python, has its own distinct features, though many times there are commonalities between programming languages.
<br>
</br>
 These languages allow computers too quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information. For example, if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and is asked to place them in ascending order, chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors.
 <br>
 </br>
 There are dozens of programming languages used in the industry today. We've compiled overviews of the 12most important, relevant and in-demand of these languages below.
 <br>
 </br>
<h4>WHO USES IT?</h4>
 <br>
 </br>
 <h4>Professions and industries:</h4>
 <br>
 </br>
 Python developers, software engineers, back and developers, python programmers.
 <br>
 </br>
 Used by employers in information technology, engineering, professional services and design
<br>
</br>

<br>
</br>
Specializations and industries: web and internet development(frameworks, micro-frameworks and advanced content management systems);scientific and numeric computing; desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
<br>
</br>
<h4>What MAKES LEARNING IT IMPORTANT?</h4>
<br>
</br>
Python lets you work quickly to integrate systems as a scripting or glue language. It's also suited for rapid application Develop (RAD).
<br>
</br>
The game civilization 4 has all its inner logic, including Al, implemented in python.
<br>
</br>
NASA uses python in its integrated Planning systems as a standard scripting language.
<br>
</br>
Features:
<br>
</br>
Simple to learn and easily read.
<br>
</br>
Associated web frameworks for developing web-based applications.
<br>
</br>
Free interpreter and standard library available in source or binary on major platforms.
<br>
</br>
<h4>WHERE DID IT START?</h4>
<br>
</br>
Python was developed in the late 1980s at CWI in the Netherlands and first released to the public in 1991.
<br>
</br>
Forums 
<br>
</br>
Stack overflow.
<br>
</br>
Python community.
<br>
</br>
Devshed Network (Python programming forum).
<br>
</br>
Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).
